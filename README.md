<p>Powered by a convolutional LSTM, built on Keras and Tensorflow. The model takes in a month of weather data, using temperature, precipitation, snowfall, and pressure as input features, and then attempts to forecast the values of those features for the next several days.</p>
<p>Made for my final project in my AP Computer Science A class, so don't expect too much right now, although I may continue to maintain and update it after graduation.</p>
